When should you use one over the other? #
If you just have to visit each node once without memory constraints (e.g. number of islands problem), then it doesn’t really matter which one you use. It comes down to your personal preference for recursion/stack vs queue.

BFS is better at:

Finding the shortest distance between two vertices
Graph of unknown size, e.g. word ladder, or even infinite size, e.g. knight shortest path
DFS is better at:

Using less memory than BFS for wide graphs since BFS has to keep all the nodes in the queue because this can be quite large for wide graphs;
Finding nodes far away from the root, e.g. looking for an exit in a maze.
